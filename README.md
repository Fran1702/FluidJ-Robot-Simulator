# FluidJ Robot Simulator

The **FluidJ Robot Simulator** is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze both forward and inverse kinematics in microrobots equipped with fluid joints. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to simulate and visualize these operations effectively.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/temp`**  
  Temporary files used for creating the mesh videos.

- **`/src`**  
  Source code for the simulator.

- **`/data`**  
  - `stl`: Contains the STL file of the end platform.  
  - `mesh`: Mesh data for the fluid joints.  
  - `vids`: Generated output videos.  
  - `figs`: Generated output figures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use the FluidJ Robot Simulator, follow these steps:

### 1. Install **Surface Evolver**
Ensure that [Surface Evolver](http://kenbrakke.com/evolver/html/install.htm) is installed on your system. Follow the official installation instructions provided on their website.

### 2. Clone the Repository
In your terminal, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fran1702/FluidJ-Robot-Simulator
```



### 3. Install Python Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd FluidJ-Robot-Simulator
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. Run the Simulator
Navigate to the `src` directory:
```bash
cd src
```

Run the forward kinematics simulation example by executing the `main_fk.py` script:

```bash
python main_fkin.py
```
